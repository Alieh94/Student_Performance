## Student Performance

## Live Demo
Try the live version of the project here:

[Student Performance Prediction App](https://student-performance-m0xr.onrender.com)

This app predicts student performance based on input features like gender, parental education, and test preparation. It showcases a machine learning pipeline integrated with Flask.

## Important Notes

- The application is hosted on Render's free tier, which puts the server to sleep after a period of inactivity. As a result, it may take 1-2 minutes for the app to load initially.
- Once the server is active, subsequent requests will load much faster.
